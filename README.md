Hello, thanks for coming! I like to do a bit of anything that involves
writing code. If you like learning and experimenting with new concepts,
we might have something in common. Occasionally I write [notes][] of
things I know, and even more infrequently I'll write a whole [blog][] post,
but you really don't need to be interested in that. If you think I might
know something you want to know but didn't yet write down, feel free to 
reach out.

There are a few experiments I would like to get to in the future,
some of which I investigated briefly but then set aside. Maybe some
of these could be of interest to someone else too:
*   A user-owned "digital identity", putting users in control of their information.
    Along with this, a few apps which might use it:
    *   An "offline social network" ([Pigeon][]), exclusively using local
        communiciation to build a sense of community in the digital age.
    *   A reimagined digital loyalty-card.
*   A multi-purpose [drag-and-drop visual programming language][drag-drop-language]
    allowing for a intuitive graph based control flow instead of the usual linear
    text-based experience.
*   An query language for existing relational databases using logic programming
    rather than SQL.
*   A more intuitive way to teach (and learn) programming and related concepts,
    emphasizing good habits and good code.

If you are similar to me and prefer to work entirely from the command line,
you may be interested in a few of the tools I built because I couldn't find
a suitable alternative elsewhere:
*   [`paper`](https://github.com/foxfriends/paper-terminal), a better
    looking Markdown typesetter.
*   [`syncat`](https://github.com/foxfriends/syncat), a tree-sitter based
    syntax highlighter, similar to `cat`, which works well with `paper`.
*   [`outline`](https://github.com/foxfriends/outline), a tool for literate
    programming (though if you are interested in this, you may also be interested
    in [Yarner][], which has gone on to be a respectable successor to `outline`).

On a related note, you may also find inspiration in my [dotfiles][] and such
if you are looking to set your environment up (or better yet, have suggestions,
as I am always looking to improve mine).

If you like board games, I have turned a few of my favourites into
browser-based games you can play online with your friends. They're
a little sketchy... but mostly playable I think. Feel free to try
them out:
*   [Settlers of Catan](https://github.com/foxfriends/catan)
*   [Tokaido](https://github.com/foxfriends/tokaido)
*   [Machi Koro](https://github.com/foxfriends/machi-koro)
*   [Mahjong](https://github.com/foxfriends/mahjong)
*   [Root](https://github.com/foxfriends/root)
