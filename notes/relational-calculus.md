# Relational Calculus

A __relational calculus__ is a system that can be used to describe the relational model
that is the basis of @[relational databases][]. In particular, there are two relational
calculi, the @[tuple relational calculus][] (which I know about) and the
@[domain relational calculus][] (which I do not know so much about, but I assume is similar).
