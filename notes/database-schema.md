# Database Schema

The __database schema__ is the definition of the @[relations][database-relation] and
their attributes in a @[relational database][]. In practice, this also includes more
than just tables and attributes, such as @[functions][], @[triggers][database-trigger],
custom data types, and @[constraints][database-constraint] that are referenced by
those tables.
