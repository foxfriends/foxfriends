# Video Games

Though some might dispute the video game as an art form, I am pretty sure they count.
Combining graphics, sound, story, interaction, and engineering, maybe the video game
is the *most complete* art form?

Might as well list some of my favourites for now? Maybe these will turn into video
game reviews one day. Some big, some small, all fun. I try to organize them into 
genre for now, though some probably could be considered to span multiple.

RPG
*   @[Hyper Light Drifter][]
*   @[The Legend of Zelda][]
*   @[Rune Factory][]
*   @[Tales][]

Slice of life (is that a game genre?)
*   @[Animal Crossing][]
*   @[Stardew Valley][]

Puzzle
*   @[Ittle Dew][]

Building
*   @[Factorio][]
*   @[Oxygen Not Included][]
*   @[Banished][]

Strategy
*   @[Fire Emblem][]
*   @[Civilization][]

I have also @[made][game-development] a few, of which I have located just the one:
*   [White](https://cameldridge.com/game/White/)

Would be down to make some more though.
