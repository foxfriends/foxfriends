# Relational Database

Relational databases represent data as *relations* (tables of *attributes*) which
reference each other to describe the relationships between different objects.

Relational databases are implemented by some @[DBMS][database-management-system], such
as @[PostgreSQL][].

Personally, if I am in need of a database, I always go to a relational database first.
They are very versatile, and provide great reliability. Only if my particular problem
had truly non-relational data would I think about using another one.
