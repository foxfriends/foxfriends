# Relational Database

__Relational databases__ represent data as *relations* (tables of *attributes*) which
reference each other to describe the relationships between different objects.
Relational databases are implemented by some @[DBMS][database-management-system], such
as @[PostgreSQL][].

Most relational databases are interacted (in practice) with by using @[SQL][]. In theory,
it can be helpful to think of the relational model using a @[relational calculus][] or
@[relational algebra][].

Personally, if I am in need of a database, I always go to a relational database first.
They are very versatile, and provide great reliability. Only if my particular problem
had truly non-relational data would I think about using another one.
